## What is Statistics?
Collecting, organizing and analysing data to make better decisions

### Two types of statistics:
1. Descriptive : Organizing and summarizing data
2. Inferential: Forming conclusions from measured data


### Population(N) and Sample(n)

* Sampling Techniques
1. Simple Random Sampling: Every member of population(N) has equal chane to become Sample(n)
2. Stratified Sampling: Population split into non-overlapping groups(strata). Example: Gender, Age groups
3. Systemic Sampling: Every nth member
4. Convinience Sampling: Members with Domain knowlegde

## Variables
Property that can take any value

* Types of varaibles:
1. Quantitative : Measured numerically. Can be added, subtracted , multiplied and divided.


* a. Discrete Quantitative: Whole numbers
* b. Continious Quantitative: Float/decimal

2. Qualitative/Categorical : Based on characteristic, categories can be derived. Example: Gender, IQ

### Variable measurement scale
4 types of measured data
1. Nominal: Categorical
2. Ordinal: Order matters, value doesnt
3. Interval: Order and value both matter. No zero value
4. Ratio: Has Zero value

### Frequency Distribution

* Frequency and Cumulative Frequency 
* Bar chart for discrete data
* Histogram for continous data ,  bins , PDF : Smoothening of Histogram
